1. One to one / One to many / Many To Many
-Have two methods to do this
a. Using embeded documents:
{
    "name": "Max",
    "cars": [
        {
            "model": "Tesla X"
            "price": 50000
        }
    ]
}
b. Using references:
{
    "_id": 12313123,
    "name": "Max",
    "cars": [
        "carsId": "teslax123"
    ]
}

{
    "_id": "teslax123"
    "model": "Tesla X"
    "price": 50000
}




How to decide which methods? 
a. For example One city has many citizens, one citizens belong to one city:
In this situation: references is more suitable as sometimes we may just need retrieve
City data, and it would be alot data overhead if citizen data is embedded inside City documents.
Besides, One city might have millions of citizen.
b. To think about which method could minimized collections files size.
c. For many to many, not necessary to use references only. It all depends on:
 i. How do you fetch the data?
 ii. How oftern do you change the data?
 iii. If you change it, do you need to change it everywhere?
 iv. Or duplication will be fine?
